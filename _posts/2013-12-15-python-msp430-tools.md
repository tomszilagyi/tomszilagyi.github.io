The [bugfix] you always hope someone else will do, but eventually you
realize that in this case that someone else is you.

The bugfix that puts you into yak-shaving mode for two weeks before
the Christmas period. Just to get you in the right mood.

There must be a special rung in hell for those who commit and release
code that never ever had any chance to actually perform its task,
because, after you digest about 400 pages of hardware documentation to
understand every bit of what is supposed to happen, realize that the
software in question violates the core specs of the interface it
claims to implement...

...and you are the lucky one that gets to debug the mess.

Nevermind. It's done. I can get on with my life now.

Christmas is coming!
