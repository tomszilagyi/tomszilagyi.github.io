Yes, this is really just fan mail. But having spent hours and hours fiddling
around with inferior dynamics processors in an attempt to convincingly
self-master some acoustic recordings I made, and getting mediocre results,
it was a revelation to discover your TAP scaling limiter plugin. It does a
phenomenal job!

I'm certainly not a proponent of gratuitous loudness, but this thing makes
trimming out those pesky low-energy transients so easy that I don't even
need to think about it any more. So I just had to say thanks for creating
such a simple, solid and effective tool. :)

And the rest of the plugins (particularly the 'verb) are great too. In fact,
for most of my Ardour sessions I hardly need anything else...

Cheers!
