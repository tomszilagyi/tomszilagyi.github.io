<h1>About the TAP-plugins project</h1>
<p>
This website holds information concerning some audio software usable
on UNIX-like operating systems, particularly GNU/Linux. The project
producing this software started out in January 2004 when the author
took the plunge of using Linux Audio (particularly <a
href="http://ardour.org">Ardour</a>) in his recording
studio. Initially four <a href="http://www.ladspa.org">LADSPA</a>
plugins were written, but the number of available plugins steadily
increased over time. Today, the package comprises an established set
of plugins.
</p>
<p>
It was in early June 2004 that the author realized he needed a reverb
solution with such flexibility that a LADSPA plugin could never
provide; not because the sound processing was lacking, but user
accessibility to the internal structure and variables of the reverb
algorithm was needed. As a result, <a href="reverbed.html">TAP Reverb
Editor</a> was written as a separate <a
href="http://jackaudio.org">JACK</a> application.
</p>
<p>
Today the project provides two software packages for download:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="https://github.com/tomszilagyi/tap-plugins">tap-plugins</a>
    </b>: A set of LADSPA plugins.</li>
<li><b><a href="/files/tap-plugins/tap-reverbed-r0.tar.gz">tap-reverbed</a>
  </b>: TAP Reverb Editor, a separate JACK app.</li>
</ul>
