<h2>TAP Reverberator</h2>
<img src="tap_reverb.png" alt="[TAP Reverberator GUI as shown in Ardour]">
<p>
<b>TAP Reverberator</b> is unique among reverberators freely available
on the Linux platform. It supports creating no less than 43
reverberation effects, but its design permits this to be extended even
further by the user, without doing any actual programming. Please take
a look at <a href="../reverbed.html">TAP Reverb Editor</a>, a separate
JACK application for more information about this.
</p>
<p>
The design is based on the comb/allpass filter model. Comb filters
create early reflections and allpass filters add to this by creating a
dense reverberation effect. The output of the set of comb and allpass
filters (also called the reverberator chamber) is processed further by
sending it through a bandpass filter. The resulting band-limited
reverberation is very similar to the natural reverberation that occurs
in acoustic rooms. To achieve an even more natural-sounding effect,
all comb filters have high-frequency compensation in their feedback
loop. This is to model that the reflection ratio of acoustic surfaces
is the function of frequency: higher frequencies are attenuated more,
and thus decay time of higher frequency components is significantly
shorter.
</p>
<p>
To enhance the reverberation sound even further, a special option
called <i>Enhanced Stereo</i> is provided. When turned on (which is
the default), it results in an added spatial spread of the reverb
sound. This feature is most noticeable when applying the plugin to
mono tracks: the sound of these tracks will "open up" in space.
</p>

<h3>Usage tips</h3>
<p>
Despite the rather complex algorithm of this plugin, usage is
relatively simple and the user is required to adjust only a limited
number of global controls. This is achieved by defining "presets"
called Reverb Types which actually mean larger sets of internal
control values. When choosing a Reverb Type, the plugin loads all
values associated to that type, and operates according to the newly
loaded values. (If you want access to the internals of a Reverb Type,
please check out <a href="../reverbed.html">TAP Reverb Editor</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The most important global variable of the whole effect is the decay
time.  By adjusting this, you can create the feel of a larger acoustic
space (set the decay to more than 2-3 seconds for this), as well as a
"tight", relatively dry effect (for which you should set a much lower
value).  But you should be aware of the fact that not every
reverberation type sounds good at any decay setting (see the table
below for recommended decay values). For example, a <i>Room
(Small)</i> will not sound too good when you set the decay to a very
large value, and vice versa, a <i>Hall (Large)</i> will not sound
optimal at very small decay settings. However, when choosing a more
artificial type of reverberation (<i>Afterburn</i>,
<i>Pulse Chamber (Reverse)</i> or <i>Warble Chamber</i>, for example),
there is no "natural" decay time: set it as you see fit according to
the effect you are trying to achieve.
</p>
<p>
General advice about adjusting the dry and wet signal levels: the wet
level should be about 3 to 15 dB lower than the dry level, according
to the reverb type you are using. Of course if you want to create an
artificial sounding effect, you can decrease the dry level, even down
to -70 dB if that is what you want. However, one thing to know is that
you shouldn't set the wet level to a very high value (generally not
above 0 dB) because the output level of the plugin may become too high
and you may overdrive the next plugin in the chain, or you may cause
signal clipping in the master output of your multitrack. Furthermore,
because the wet signal is added to the incoming dry signal, you should
decrease the dry level as well by a few dB-s (and then set the wet
level according to this) so as not to raise the overall loudness of
the track.
</p>
<p>
Usually, when trying to create a natural-sounding reverberation
effect, all components (comb filters, allpass filters, the bandpass
filter and the stereo enhancement mode) should be switched
on. However, to create artificial effects, it is possible to turn off
any of these components. For example, if you only want the sound of
multiple echoes, you can turn off everything but the comb filters; if
you want to create a more unnatural, harsh effect, turn off the
bandpass filter processing. (Also note that bandpass filters of
different Reverb Types have different low and high cutoff frequencies,
since this filtering also affects the nature of the reverberated sound
very much.) Naturally, components that are switched off don't consume
CPU power.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, not all Reverb Types sound good with any decay
setting. The following table contains decay time settings adequate for
particular Reverb Types. Decay times are shown in seconds. As a rule of
thumb, when decay times are above 3 seconds, the "Wet Level" should be
at least 6 or more decibels below the "Dry Level". <i>The values
below are only general advice, and they are provided merely as a
starting point for your experimentation. You are free to use any value
that sounds good for your mix.</i>

<p>
<b>Q:</b> <i>What is that HD in the name of some Reverb Types?</i>
</p>
<p>
<b>A:</b> HD stands for <i>High Density</i>. Reverb Types marked with
this are enhanced versions of other types, for example <i>Hall (Large)
- HD</i> is derived from <i>Hall (Large)</i>. Enhancement means
additional comb and/or allpass filters, which result in an even
smoother reverberation effect. However, more filters mean more CPU
usage, so it's up to you to decide whether to choose them or not. If
CPU usage is not a great concern, it is recommended to use the HD
versions where available.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The maximum number of filters is 20 combs and 20 allpass
filters. Actually it is double this much because every filter exists
in two instances for the two channels.  This amount allows for the
creation of very dense, very smooth-sounding Reverb Types.
</p>
<p>
Comb filters are implemented as first-order IIR filters with a
biquadratic low-pass filter in the feedback loop, which has its cutoff
frequency determined by the frequency response parameter of the comb
filter. Allpass filters are implemented as ordinary first-order IIR
filters.
</p>
<p>
When <i>Enhanced Stereo</i> is enabled, parameters of the two
instances of the same filter are set to slightly different values.
Without this option, the two input channels are processed in the exact
same way. It is absolutely recommended to turn this on when applying
the plugin to mono tracks, but it is also useful on stereo tracks.
</p>
<p>
Because the varying complexity of Reverb Types and the fact that
options can be switched on/off individually, CPU usage is a function
of user settings. For this reason, this plugin is not hard RT
capable. The CPU usage was measured with all options turned on, and
the Reverb Type set to <i>Ambience (Thick) - HD</i>, which is the most
complex one at the moment. Other Reverb Types with fewer
comb/allpass filters utilize proportionately less CPU.
