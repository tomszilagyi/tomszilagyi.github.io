<h2>TAP DeEsser</h2>
<img src="tap_deesser.png" alt="[TAP DeEsser GUI as shown in Ardour]">
<p>
<b>TAP DeEsser</b> is a plugin for attenuating higher pitched
frequencies in vocals such as those found in 'ess', 'shh' and 'chh'
sounds. Almost any vocal recording will contain 'ess' sounds, whether
a strong vocal delivery, from bad recording, speech impediments or
simply many 'ess' words spoken together. Wind instruments and other
musical instruments can also create shrill high-pitched noises. Audio
engineers need to control these harsh 'ess' sounds in most recordings.
</p>

<h3>Usage tips</h3>
<p>
Audio input is fed into the audio path and the so-called Sidechain. In
the Sidechain, the signal is filtered and then an attenuation value is
computed based on the filter output. This computation is done using a
hard-knee compressor characteristic with a threshold level set by the
"Threshold" control and a compression ratio of 1:2. The compressor
attack/release time is 10 ms for instant operation.
</p>
<p>
The filter applied to the Sidechain signal has two modes of operation:
Highpass and Bandpass. Highpass mode is useful for attenuating several
different 'ess' sounds. Bandpass mode is more suitable for attenuating
a specific high frequency. The chosen filter's frequency is set by the
"Frequency" control.
</p>
<p>
General advice about setting the "Frequency" control: The sounds
attenuated by this plugin can be fit into four categories: male 'ess',
male 'ssh', female 'ess' and female 'ssh' sounds. 'Shh' settings are
quite applicable for 'ch', 'th', and hard consonants, such as 't',
'd', and 'k' as well. The following table lists frequencies for these
four types of sounds. Note that these are only provided as a starting
point for your own experimentations, as the characteristic frequencies
of individual vocalists can vary in a suprisingly wide range. Use your
ears!
</p>

<h3>Recommended frequency values</h3>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" border="1">
<tr><td>Male 'ess'</td><td>4500 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Male 'ssh'</td><td>3400 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Female 'ess'</td><td>6800 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Female 'ssh'</td><td>5100 Hz</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
Generally, female 'ess' and 'shh' sounds vary more in frequency than
those of males. Due to this situation, you may find that using the
Sidechain filter in the Highpass mode may be more responsive.
Otherwise, with the Sidechain filter in Bandpass mode, only a narrow
frequency area is being responded to. So if a singer has esses with
varying frequency, try the Highpass mode of the Sidechain.
</p>
<p>
When choosing between Sidechain modes (e.g. Highpass or Bandpass) and
setting the "Frequency" it may be very helpful to hear the Sidechain
signal, which controls the compression of the through-passing audio:
this is why the Monitor control is provided. While listening to the
Sidechain signal, try to set the controls so that almost everything
you want attenuated can be well heard, and even more importantly,
almost everything you want to keep intact doesn't show up in the
Sidechain sound.
</p>
<p>
Another aid in setting the plugin is the "Attenuation" output meter:
this shows the momentary attenuation applied to the signal. It
shouldn't show a significant attenuation all the time. Instead, it
should indicate that attenuation springs into action only
occassionally.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
Setting the "Threshold" too low will result in an unpleasant muffled
sound. Also, if the singer starts sounding as if she had suddenly lost
her teeth, take this as a sure sign that your "Threshold" setting is
way too low. Use the ever popular Bypass button and watch out for side
effects like this.
</p>
<p>
This plugin is best on vocal tracks, although it can be applied to
mixed tracks as well. However, you should expect an increased amount
of side effects (especially muffling and pumping of the sound) when
attempting to de-ess the vocals of a mixed track.
</p>
<p>
Internal variables that depend on user settings are re-computed only
when the corresponding user settings are changed. This keeps the
plugin from being hard RT capable, although the effect of this
occassional re-computation is not really noticeable when looking at
CPU usage measures.
</p>
<p>
Because the Sidechain processing algorithm involves converting from
linear to decibel values for every sample, a custom, very fast lin2db
function was implemented via a log10 table, which is computed and
stored when the plugin library is loaded by the host. Without this
hack (that is, calling <code>log10f()</code> for every sample), CPU
usage would be almost exactly twice this much.
