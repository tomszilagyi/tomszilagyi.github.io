<h2>TAP TubeWarmth</h2>
<img src="tap_tubewarmth.png" alt="[TAP TubeWarmth GUI as shown in Ardour]">
<p>
<b>TAP TubeWarmth</b> adds the character of vacuum tube amplification
to your audio tracks by emulating the sonically desirable nonlinear
characteristics of triodes. In addition, this plugin also supports
emulating analog tape saturation.

<h3>Usage tips</h3>
<p>
Tube preamps and reel-to-reel tape recorders have been around for a
long time. Until the end of the seventies, the sound of almost every
great recording bears the watermarks of these intrinsically nonlinear
devices. In the eighties everything went digital, and the "harmful",
"non-perfect" nonlinearities were greatly eliminated from the
recording and mix-down process. However, it became clearly obvious
shortly afterwards, that without these nonlinear artifacts recordings
often sound dull, boring, colourless and thin, just like a piece of
plastic. As a result, efforts have been made to bring the sound of
analog equipment back to the studio -- with the power of DSP. This
plugin offers the sound of these analog devices, but without the
high-frequency roll-off of tube amps and the hiss of reel-to-reel tape
machines. With this plugin applied and properly adjusted, many types
of source materials will sound subtly richer, warmer, fatter, and
closer.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Drive</i> slider adjusts the amount of the effect. Values
between 2 and 5 are a good starting point for a variety of source
materials. Since audio tracks can vary quite a bit in average and peak
levels, experiment with this setting and use your ears to get the
sound you want. (It's quite easy if you <i>know</i> how real tube amps
sound like...) If the drive level is set too high, the signal will
most likely sound distorted. If it's too low, you may not hear the
effect working.
</p>
<p>
The <i>Tape--Tube Blend</i> slider controls the colour of the
TubeWarmth sound. When set all the way to the right (+10 or default
position), the plugin emulates the sound of triode tube
distortion. The result is asymmetrical, producing mostly second
harmonics and some third. When set all the way to the left (-10), the
plugin emulates the sound of analog tape. The result is symmetrical
and produces mostly third harmonics and some second. With high drive
settings, moving the blend control to the left increases the apparent
loudness of low-level signals dramatically. This is because the
zero-attack, zero-release compression effect is increased under these
conditions. Use the blend control to set the sound of the plugin
anywhere between Tape and Tube sound.
</p>
<p>
In multitrack production work, using TAP TubeWarmth on selected
individual tracks before the mixdown is generally a smart
idea. Applying the plugin to electric guitars and bass is essential. A
smaller amount applied to cymbals can make their sound substantially
richer. Also, don't miss a try on your keyboards and vocals. Start
with <i>Tape--Tube Blend</i> set to +10 for tube emulation, which is
the default. This generally has a more musical effect than tape
emulation, but of course this will depend on the source material,
taste, and the dictates of your project.
</p>
<p>
To warm up a stereo mix during mastering, a <i>Drive</i> setting of 2
or 1 or even lower may be most appropriate, but this depends on the
overall level. Look for an increase in the apparent loudness or
fattening of the low end, and that warm tube sound. Too much effect
and you'll hear the low end get too loose and/or the top end get too
sizzly.
</p>
<p>
TAP TubeWarmth does not limit high frequency response. Some tube
circuits, especially preamps with high gain, will start to roll off
before 20 kHz. This is due to the plate-to-grid Miller
capacitance. The plugin purposefully does not do this. If you want to
limit highs (which can, in itself, make things sound a little warmer)
use an <a href="eq.html">equalizer</a> plugin. You could do this
before but will probably want to do it after processing with
TubeWarmth.

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>
The <i>Drive</i> setting and the signal level are independent but
related. Essentially the same results can be obtained by processing a
low-level signal with a high drive setting as by processing a
high-level signal with a low drive setting. The net effect on the
signal will be the same in either case, with the only difference being
the level of the resultant signal.
