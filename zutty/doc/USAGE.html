<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Installation">
<p>
You will probably need to install Zutty from source. This is not as
scary as it might seem, because Zutty has very few dependencies and is
a relatively small program.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-1.%20Install%20build%20dependencies" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="1.%20Install%20build%20dependencies">1. Install build dependencies</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1.%20Install%20build%20dependencies">
<p>
On a recent (stable or testing) Debian, or a Debian-derivative such as
Ubuntu, the following command will make sure everything you need to
build Zutty is in place.
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo apt-get install \
   build-essential pkg-config python3 \
   libegl-dev libfreetype-dev libgles-dev libxmu-dev
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2.%20Obtain%20the%20source" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="2.%20Obtain%20the%20source">2. Obtain the source</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2.%20Obtain%20the%20source">
<p>
Clone the source from git:
</p>
<pre class="example">
git clone https://github.com/tomszilagyi/zutty.git
cd zutty
</pre>


<p>
Alternatively, to download a compressed tarball of a certain release
version, go to <a href="https://github.com/tomszilagyi/zutty/releases">https://github.com/tomszilagyi/zutty/releases</a>, download
the tarball you want (we recommend the latest one), and uncompress it.
Further steps assume that your working directory is within the
uncompressed directory, so <code>cd</code> into it!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-3.%20Configure%20the%20source" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="3.%20Configure%20the%20source">3. Configure the source</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3.%20Configure%20the%20source">
<p>
You are supposed to be inside the repository (or release) directory
structure, i.e., the <code>zutty</code> directory created above should be your
working directory. Issue this command:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./waf configure
</pre>


<p>
You should see some output with a confirmation of the Zutty version
you are going to build, and whether you are creating a Debug build (it
should say "no" at this point; read the <a href="./HACKING.html">Development guide</a> if you are
interested in debugging Zutty).
</p>

<p>
You should also see checks for the presence of the build
dependencies. If anything is missing, the configure script will
terminate with an error. Otherwise, the configure output will finish
with a line like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
'configure' finished successfully (0.373s)
</pre>


<p>
In case you will want to install the <code>zutty</code> executable to somewhere
other than <code>/usr/local/bin</code>, use the <code>--prefix</code> option to specify the
installation prefix (the default is <code>/usr/local</code>). For example, I
often install stuff for my user account only, in which case I would
issue <code>./waf configure --prefix=/home/tom/root</code> so that later on,
<code>zutty</code> would end up installed as <code>/home/tom/root/bin/zutty</code>.
</p>

<p>
If you would like to learn more, <code>./waf --help</code> lists a reference of
every option you can use.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-4.%20Compile%20the%20source" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="4.%20Compile%20the%20source">4. Compile the source</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4.%20Compile%20the%20source">
<p>
Just type:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./waf
</pre>


<p>
Alternatively, if you want to specify the number of jobs to run in
parallel, issue <code>./waf -j 4</code> (substitute your number of CPU cores in
place of 4).
</p>

<p>
The compilation messages should be self-explanatory (assuming you do
not run into C++ error messages &#x2013; decoding those is an art form in its
own right). A successful compile ends with a line like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
'build' finished successfully (23.524s)
</pre>


<p>
At this point, the <code>zutty</code> executable is complete and ready to be run
at <code>build/src/zutty</code> and you might want to launch it just to see if it
works. You can run it without arguments to start it up with defaults,
or add <code>-h</code> (or <code>-help</code>) to learn about available options. (Don't
worry, those will be covered in detail below.)
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-5.%20Install%20Zutty" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="5.%20Install%20Zutty">5. Install Zutty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5.%20Install%20Zutty">
<p>
For regular use, it is best to copy the <code>zutty</code> executable to a
system-wide directory for binaries where it will be found as part of
the default executable search path. This makes it easier to launch and
also decouples it from any local changes. You can manually copy the
executable built in the previous step, but it might be easier to use
the built-in install step in the <code>waf</code> script. Running it with <code>sudo</code>
will ensure that it is able to write to protected system-wide
locations:
</p>

<pre class="example">
sudo ./waf install
</pre>


<p>
Note that your ability to run the above command (with <code>sudo</code>) is
contingent on the presence of <code>sudo</code>, the setup of your user account
with respect to sudo, etc. If it does not work, please search the web
or ask your friendly local guru. Also, if you have specified an
install location that is actually yours (like the one I showed above)
then of course there is no point in using <code>sudo</code>.
</p>

<p>
At the end, you should see something like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
'install' finished successfully (0.135s)
</pre>


<p>
Congratulations, you are now ready to start using Zutty as your
terminal!
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Configuration" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Configuration">Configuration</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Configuration">
<p>
<code>zutty</code> has a set of configuration options, all of which have:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a command line option;</li>
<li>an X resource database (Xrdb) key;</li>
<li>a sensible hard default.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For each option, the above list defines the order of preference.  That
is, the command line can be used to define a setting in a transient
way; Xrdb entries may be used to persistently alter the default value
for an option; and lastly, without any input from the user, <code>zutty</code>
should still have a workable default.
</p>

<p>
To view the list of options, issue <code>zutty -h</code> (short for <code>-help</code>):
</p>

<pre class="example">
Usage:
  zutty [-option ...] [shell]

Options:
  -altScroll   Alternate scroll mode
  -bg          Background color (default: 000000)
  -border      Border width in pixels (default: 2)
  -display     Display to connect to
  -fg          Foreground color (default: ffffff)
  -font        Font to use (default: 9x18)
  -fontsize    Font size (default: 16)
  -fontpath    Font search path (default: /usr/share/fonts)
  -geometry    Terminal size in chars (default: 80x24)
  -glinfo      Print OpenGL information
  -help        Print usage information
  -rv          Reverse video
  -selection   Selection target (default: primary)
  -shell       Shell program to run (default: /bin/bash)
  -title       Window title (default: Zutty)
  -quiet       Silence logging output
  -verbose     Output info messages
  -e           Command line to run
</pre>


<p>
All options can be abbreviated as long as they are non-ambiguous, so
it's fine to write <code>-d</code> short for <code>-display</code>, <code>-gl</code> for <code>-glinfo</code>,
<code>-fontp</code> for <code>-fontpath</code>, <code>-t</code> for <code>-title</code>, <code>-q</code> for <code>-quiet</code>, etc.
</p>

<p>
Boolean options (<code>-altScroll</code>, <code>-glinfo</code>, <code>-help</code>, <code>-rv</code>, <code>-quiet</code>,
<code>-verbose</code>) do not expect an argument; the presence of these options
amounts to a setting of "true". Other options expect exactly one
argument, with the exception of <code>-e</code>, which must be the last option,
to be followed by the command line to run.
</p>

<p>
The options are further documented below, grouped into sections by
topic. To set up a persistent configuration (altered defaults), see
the next section <a href="#Persistent%20configuration">Persistent configuration</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-Basic%20configuration%20and%20mode%20switches" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Basic%20configuration%20and%20mode%20switches">Basic configuration and mode switches</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Basic%20configuration%20and%20mode%20switches">
<pre class="example">
-altScroll   Alternate scroll mode [boolean]
</pre>


<p>
If enabled, scroll up and down events (generated by the mouse scroll
wheel) are converted to virtual up- and down-arrow keypresses. This
might prove to be a convenient method of moving up/down one at a
time in programs where one usually navigates with the keyboard arrows.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-display     Display to connect to
</pre>


<p>
The X display to connect to. By default, the value of the environment
variable DISPLAY is used.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-glinfo      Print OpenGL information [boolean]
</pre>


<p>
If enabled, Zutty will query and log some GL variables on program
startup. These include EGL_VERSION, EGL_VENDOR, EGL_EXTENSIONS, as
well as GL_RENDERER, GL_VERSION, GL_VENDOR, GL_EXTENSIONS, and numeric
limits on the Compute Shader implementation. This is mostly a
debugging aid. The output is not affected by any verbosity changes
made via <code>-v</code> / <code>-q</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-help        Print usage information [boolean]
</pre>


<p>
Print the help message containing the list of options documented here,
and quit.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-selection   Selection target (default: primary)
</pre>


<p>
Set the X Selection to use as the target of copy (and the source of
paste) operations. There are three options: <code>primary</code>, <code>secondary</code> and
<code>clipboard</code>. Only the first character of the argument is used (<code>'p'</code>,
<code>'s'</code>, <code>'c'</code>) to discriminate between these.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-shell       Shell program to run (default: /bin/bash)
</pre>


<p>
Specify the shell program to run in the terminal. As a bit of special
syntax, this option can be passed both as a regular option (<code>-shell
bash</code> anywhere among other options), or just the shell itself (<code>bash</code>)
at the end of the command line, mutually exclusive with using the <code>-e</code>
option. If both forms are present, the last item on the command line
will take precedence over the value supplied after <code>-shell</code>.
</p>

<p>
The algorithm to determine the actual shell program to spawn closely
resembles Xterm behaviour and follows these steps:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with the <code>shell</code> value (the last argument given after all
valid options, if present, or the value supplied after <code>-shell</code>).</li>
<li>Try to construct an absolute path taking <code>$PATH</code> into account;
this includes resolving relative paths and trying elements of the
list of <code>$PATH</code> entries until it resolves to an existing file.</li>
<li>Fall back on <code>$SHELL</code>, then the user's <code>/etc/passwd</code> shell entry,
if the above did not result in any candidate.</li>
<li>Use <code>/bin/sh</code> as a last resort.</li>
<li>Validate the outcome of the above steps against the permitted shell
entries found in <code>/etc/shells</code>; proceed, but clear <code>$SHELL</code> from
the spawned program's environment if the program is not listed as a
valid shell.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In accordance with the general precedence of configuration lookups, in
case a <code>shell</code> argument is <b>not</b> given, the <code>zutty.shell</code> resource is
consulted; if that is not set, the built-in default of <code>/bin/bash</code> is
assumed as the result of step 0 (and then steps 1-4 carried out as
above).
</p>

<pre class="example">
-e           Command line to run
</pre>


<p>
This option specifies the command line (program and arguments) to be
run in the Zutty terminal window. It also sets the window title to the
basename of the program to be executed.
</p>

<p>
Note that this must be the last option on the command line, as
everything after it will be passed verbatim to the spawned child
process.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-quiet       Silence logging output [boolean]
-verbose     Output info messages [boolean]
</pre>


<p>
These options control the verbosity of log output emitted by
Zutty. You will only observe the effects of these if you run Zutty
itself from another terminal (as opposed to some launcher that
discards the program's output). In that case, you will notice output
that looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
I [font.cc: 54] Loading /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/9x18.pcf.gz as primary
I [font.cc:198] Glyph size 9x18
...
I [main.cc:118] Window ID: 48234498 / 0x2e00002
I [charvdev.cc:377] Resize to 935 x 771 pixels, 103 x 42 chars
</pre>


<p>
The first letter is an indication of the log level or "severity"; <code>E</code>
means Error, <code>W</code> stands for Warning, <code>I</code> is Info and <code>T</code> is Trace.
Trace will only be output if you compile Zutty into a debug build; see
the <a href="./HACKING.html">Development guide</a> for details. Next, the origin of the log message
is shown in square brackets, indicating the source code location
(filename and line number) where the message was printed. Then comes
the actual message.
</p>

<p>
By default (if neither <code>-quiet</code> nor <code>-verbose</code> is given), Zutty will
print errors and warnings, but not info messages. If <code>-verbose</code> is
given, info messages are also printed. On the other hand, if <code>-quiet</code>
is given, nothing is printed. If both options are given, <code>-quiet</code>
wins.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-General%20appearance" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="General%20appearance">General appearance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-General%20appearance">
<pre class="example">
-geometry    Terminal size in chars (default: 80x24)
</pre>


<p>
This option defines the desired initial size of the terminal as
measured in characters. (The pixel size of the window will be a
function of this plus the font geometry, and cannot be specified
directly.)
</p>

<p>
This is just a request to the window manager; <code>zutty</code> will accept and
work with whatever final window size it gets. Setting this will in no
way interfere with your ability to resize <code>zutty</code> once it is up and
running.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-bg          Background color (default: 000000)
-fg          Foreground color (default: ffffff)
</pre>


<p>
These options accept a hexadecimal RRGGBB color specification, similar
to how you can define a color in many other places, e.g., CSS.
Both lower- and uppercase hexadecimals (a-f, A-F) are accepted, but
note that names (e.g., "red" instead of "ff0000") are <b>not</b> supported.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-rv          Reverse video [boolean]
</pre>


<p>
Using this option will swap the effective foreground and background
color, specified either via <code>-fg</code> and <code>-bg</code>, or the corresponding
resources, or the defaults. It will <b>not</b> swap the meaning of color
codes and such; if a program explicitly specifies the color green, it
will be rendered green with and without <code>-rv</code>.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-border      Border width in pixels (default: 2)
</pre>


<p>
Specify the border width, specifically, the border that is part of the
client area of the Zutty window and not part of any window decoration
itself (this is equivalent to what Xterm calls internal border width).
</p>

<pre class="example">
-title       Window title (default: Zutty)
</pre>


<p>
Set the title of the Zutty window. This might be overridden by usage
of the <code>-e</code> option (setting the title to the basename of the program
to be run), or at any later time by escape sequences output by the
shell (or any program executed by it).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Font%20selection" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Font%20selection">Font selection</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Font%20selection">
<p>
Zutty employs a simple but powerful model of font selection. Font
files are located under a search path and loaded by Zutty itself
(bypassing any infrastructure such as a font server, etc). In
principle, any font that is supported by the Freetype font library can
be used; in practice, only monospace fonts make sense. Both fixed size
(bitmap) fonts and scaled (vectorized) fonts are supported.
</p>

<p>
You specify the font to use by its name, which will be part of the
actual filename(s) that store the font. Multiple variants of the font
will be sought after: Zutty will try to find a Regular, a Bold, an
Italic and a Bold Italic variant of the font you specify. It is not an
error if these do not exist, as long as the primary variant (Regular)
is found.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-font        Font to use (default: 9x18)
</pre>


<p>
This option specifies the font name to use. The name supplied will
form the basis of a case-insensitive search under the font search
path. The search will try to locate a set of files under the same
subdirectory, starting with the supplied name and ending with the same
extension that is one of the recognized font file extensions. If such
a set of files is found, the full filenames (the parts after the
specified font name) will be used to assign the files to each variant
sought after.
</p>

<p>
For example, the default font is <code>9x18</code>. This is one of the "misc
fixed" fonts. After seeing that the font name is "9x18", Zutty will
search under the font path <code>/usr/share/fonts</code> for files starting with
"9x18". It will find <code>9x18.pcf.gz</code> and <code>9x18B.pcf.gz</code>, both under
<code>/usr/share/fonts/X11/misc</code>. Based on the filenames, Zutty will
recognize the first file as the regular variant, and the second file
as the bold variant. Other variants are absent; use of text attributes
that depend on them will result in sensible fallbacks.
</p>

<p>
As a second example, we will load a scaled font called Liberation Mono
by supplying <code>-font LiberationMono</code> (or <code>-font liberationmono</code>) to
Zutty. This will result in several files found, all under
<code>/usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation</code>: <code>LiberationMono-Regular.ttf</code>,
<code>LiberationMono-Bold.ttf</code>, <code>LiberationMono-Italic.ttf</code> and
<code>LiberationMono-BoldItalic.ttf</code>. These files will be loaded as the
respective variants of the chosen font.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-fontsize    Font size (default: 16)
</pre>


<p>
For scaled fonts, such as Liberation Mono above, this setting controls
the height, measured in pixels, to rasterize the glyphs to. The actual
character grid size will almost always be more, due to the fact that
typefaces have some spacing around the actual glyphs.
</p>

<p>
The specified size, if within one pixel of the size of a bitmap
strike, will result in picking that strike (pre-rasterized version)
from a scaled font with strikes. If there are no strikes, or the
specified size is too far from any pre-rasterized sizes, Zutty falls
back to rendering the outline at the requested size.
</p>

<p>
In case of a fixed size font with multiple bitmap sizes, the size
closest to the configured size will be selected.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-fontpath    Font search path (default: /usr/share/fonts)
</pre>


<p>
This option specifies the root of the directory structure where font
files will be searched. It is seldom necessary to change this, but
might be useful to try some new font you downloaded from the Internet
(and have not yet installed to a system-wide location).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Recommended%20fonts" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="Recommended%20fonts">Recommended fonts</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Recommended%20fonts">
<p>
The author of Zutty prefers the so-called "misc fixed" fonts that were
created in the '80s in an era of much inferior computer displays.
These are the original fonts designed to be used with the X Window
System, and their availability is universal &#x2013; you probably have them
already installed. These fonts are highly optimized for readability at
low resolutions. There is a convenient range of sizes, several fonts
have bold variants and support thousands of international characters
and symbols outside ASCII. Zutty will work best with any of misc-fixed
6x13, 7x13, 7x14, 8x13, 9x15 and 9x18 (there are more, but the ones
listed have a bold-face variant as well).
</p>

<p>
If you prefer scalable fonts (e.g., because you have a high-resolution
HiDPI display or prefer LARGE glyphs with a more modern look), Zutty
works well with freely available scaled terminal fonts such as
Anonymous Pro, Deja Vu Sans Mono, Free Mono, Hack, Inconsolata,
Liberation Mono, Source Code Pro, and possibly many more.
</p>

<p>
On Debian (and derived) distributions, the following list of package
names might serve as a useful starting point to obtain some usable
fonts. For each package, install it and pass the specified name(s) to
<code>-font</code> to check them out:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>xfonts-base</code>: 6x13, 7x13, 7x14, 8x13, 9x15, 9x18</li>
<li><code>fonts-dejavu-core</code>: DejaVuSansMono</li>
<li><code>fonts-liberation</code>: LiberationMono</li>
<li><code>fonts-freefont-ttf</code>: FreeMono</li>
<li><code>fonts-hack-otf</code>: Hack</li>
<li><code>fonts-inconsolata</code>: Inconsolata</li>
<li><code>ttf-anonymous-pro</code>: "Anonymous Pro"</li>
</ul>

<p>

The configuration options documented in the previous chapter
<a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a> can be assigned altered defaults by adding entries to
the X resource database. Refer to the previous chapter for the list
and semantics of all options; here we show how to add entries for them
to your X resource database (Xrdb).
</p>

<p>
Open the file <code>.Xresources</code> in your home directory, or create it if
you do not have one. Use the following snippet as a starting point;
feel free to remove any lines with options you do not want to change
from the hard default, and add lines for any further options you do
want to change.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Zutty.title:                   Zero Cost TTY
Zutty.geometry:                120x45
Zutty.altScroll:               true
Zutty.selection:               clipboard
Zutty.font:                    SourceCodePro
Zutty.fontsize:                18
Zutty.fontpath:                /home/tom/doc/fonts
Zutty.fg:                      00ff80
Zutty.bg:                      203040
</pre>


<p>
As you can see, the general pattern is simple: one setting per line,
starting with a key that looks like <code>Zutty.&lt;option-name&gt;</code>, a colon,
and the desired value in a second column. The option names are exactly
as documented in the previous chapter.
</p>

<p>
Note that no quoting is necessary around string values containing a
space, and that the value <code>true</code> is explicit unlike on the command
line.
</p>

<p>
Once you are satisfied with your settings, save your <code>~/.Xresources</code>
and run the command <code>xrdb -merge ~/.Xresources</code> to instruct Xrdb to
merge the new settings from your file to the in-memory resource
database. Alternatively, just restart your X session (log out and back
in to your graphics desktop).
</p>

<p>
The configured values will show up in the output of <code>zutty -h</code>, to
confirm that your settings have taken effect. For example, if you were
following along, you should now see
</p>

<pre class="example">
-title       Window title (configured: Zero Cost TTY)
</pre>


<p>
instead of the original version that read
</p>

<pre class="example">
-title       Window title (default: Zutty)
</pre>


<p>
Removing a configuration is a bit tricky. Even if you remove a setting
from <code>~/.Xresources</code> and merge that into Xrdb, the previous setting
will still persist in-memory until you restart your X session. To get
around this, you might issue <code>xrdb -remove Zutty.title</code> (change
<code>title</code> to the name of the option you want to reset to its default).
</p>

<p>
Now that you have a tailored baseline of how you expect Zutty to start
up without any explicit options, remember that you can still override
any of these on the command line!
