<p>
If you plan to spend time hacking on Zutty, you should first compile a
debug build of it. The purpose of this is to compile in trace logging
output, as well as debugging facilities.
</p>

<p>
To configure the build for this development mode, add the option
<code>--debug</code> to the configuration:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./waf configure --debug
</pre>


<p>
Feel free to add any other options you usually use for the normal
build. Confirm that you see this line in the output:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Debug build                              : yes
</pre>


<p>
Then, compile Zutty as usual:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./waf [-j &lt;JOBS&gt;]
</pre>


<p>
Normally, you will not want to install the development build
system-wide. Run it from an existing terminal as <code>./build/src/zutty
-v</code> (plus any other options) to receive verbose debugging logs in the
console.
</p>

<p>
As stated in the <a href="./USAGE.html">Usage guide</a>, by default (if neither <code>-quiet</code> nor
<code>-verbose</code> is given), Zutty will print errors and warnings, but not
info messages. Those have to be enabled with <code>-verbose</code>, and in case
of a debug build, that will enable Trace messages as well.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-The%20Step%20Debugger" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="The%20Step%20Debugger">The Step Debugger</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-The%20Step%20Debugger">
<p>
A debug build of Zutty has compiled-in support not just for generating
lots of trace output, but also for a facility called the Step
Debugger. This is a facility specifically built to enable close
inspection of the virtual terminal in action.
</p>

<p>
The Step Debugger is initially dormant; it can be activated by
pressing the "debug key", which is hardwired to PrintScreen (but the
hook for it is only compiled in the debug build, so it does not affect
the PrintScreen key in a normal build).
</p>

<p>
When the Step Debugger is activated, the Zutty process will suspend
itself on the completion of every N-th escape sequence (i.e., when the
state machine is set back to "normal text input"), with N cycled
through 1, 10, 100 and zero (off) on each additional press of the
PrintScreen key.
</p>

<p>
Move focus to the Zutty window, press PrintScreen, and confirm that
you see this line in the log output:
</p>

<pre class="example">
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=1
</pre>


<p>
The <code>step=1</code> communicates that going forward, Zutty will suspend
itself on every completed escape sequence. To test this, type
something (I am typing the letter <code>k</code>) and then hit Backspace. This
will trigger the Debug Stop, and the log will look similar to this:
</p>

<pre class="example">
T [vterm.icc:392] pty write (mod=0): 'k' (1 bytes)
T [vterm.icc:439] pty read: 'k' (1 bytes)
T [vterm.icc:683] hideCursor []         p(0,48)  d(42,103)  mgn[0,42)  hmgn:0 [0,103)  cur=48  head=0
T [vterm.icc:109] Inserted: 'k' (1 bytes)
T [vterm.icc:670] showCursor []         p(0,49)  d(42,103)  mgn[0,42)  hmgn:0 [0,103)  cur=49  head=0
T [vterm.icc:428] pty write: '\x7f' (1 bytes)
T [vterm.icc:439] pty read: '\b\e[K' (4 bytes)
T [vterm.icc:683] hideCursor []         p(0,49)  d(42,103)  mgn[0,42)  hmgn:0 [0,103)  cur=49  head=0
T [vterm.icc:983] csi_CUB []    p(0,49)  d(42,103)  mgn[0,42)  hmgn:0 [0,103)  cur=49  head=0
T [vterm.icc:1229] csi_EL [0]   p(0,48)  d(42,103)  mgn[0,42)  hmgn:0 [0,103)  cur=48  head=0
T [vterm.icc: 50] *** DEBUG STOP (step=1), 4 bytes since last:
        '\b\e[K' (4 bytes)
T [vterm.icc: 55] Issue 'kill -CONT 5429' or 'fg' to continue.
</pre>


<p>
Following the trace log, we can see that first the keypress was sent
to the shell (<code>pty write</code>), then the echoed character was read back
from the shell (<code>pty read</code>), which triggered an insertion of <code>k</code> as
text. The screen-updating is surrounded by hiding and showing the
cursor. Then, as a consequence of the Backspace keypress, Zutty sends
the <code>DEL</code> character (<code>\x7f</code>) to the shell, which echoes back <code>\b\e[K</code>:
first <code>\b</code>, a backspace character, followed by <code>\e[K</code>, or a "CSI K"
sequence in VT100-speak, which instructs Zutty to clear the terminal
screen from the cursor to the end of line. Since this constitutes a
finished escape sequence, this is the point where the Debug Stop
occurs.
</p>

<p>
As part of processing the input stream from the terminal, Zutty
executed the functions <code>csi_CUB</code> (interpreting <code>\b</code>) and <code>csi_EL</code>
(interpreting <code>\e[K</code>). The former stands for Cursor Back, the latter
for Erase Line &#x2013; these are the names of the requested screen
operations according to the VT100-series standards. The arguments
parsed from the input escape sequences, effective at the time of the
function call, are visible in square brackets. The single argument
zero (shown as <code>[0]</code>) passed to the Erase Line routine is the implicit
default; the actual escape sequence did not contain a numeric
argument.
</p>

<p>
Also worth noting is that on each trace point (such as <code>hideCursor</code>,
<code>showCursor</code>, <code>csi_CUB</code>, etc.) several state variables are printed.
These include the current cursor position <code>(0,49)</code>, the dimensions
<code>(42,103)</code>, the horizontal scrolling margin top and bottom <code>[0,42)</code>
(the mismatched brackets denote that the top row of scrolling is
inclusive of the scrolling range, while the bottom row is exclusive).
Also dumped are Frame-internal offsets <code>cur</code> and <code>head</code>.
</p>

<p>
To resume Zutty, send a continue signal (SIGCONT) via kill, or just
type <code>fg</code> into the terminal running Zutty. The latter is a neat trick
that relies on the parent terminal detecting that the child process
has been stopped, and putting it into the background.
</p>

<p>
When trying to understand how the virtual terminal processes a longer
input sequence, it becomes tedious to step through each escape
sequence one by one. Pressing PrintScreen will cycle through the
number of debug steps to go between each stop: first 1, then 10, 100,
then 0 (the Step Debugger is turned off), then back to 1, 10, 100,
then off again, etc. While doing this, you will see this in the output
log:
</p>

<pre class="example">
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=10
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=100
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=0
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=1
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=10
T [vterm.icc: 40] *** DEBUG step=100

<p>
By their very nature, graphical terminal emulators are interactive
programs. Therefore, testing them in an automated fashion (e.g., for
regression testing) can be tricky.
</p>

<p>
We employ a method suitable as a general means to automation, as it is
independent of the terminal under test: it does not require modifying
the program by e.g., implementing test hooks to inject events or report
screen content. This allows us to include several established terminal
emulators in the test along with Zutty to research the state of the
art and see how different programs stack up against each other.
</p>

<p>
Prerequisites:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
imagemagick (for convert &amp; identify), wmctrl, xvkbd
</p>
<pre class="example">
apt-get install imagemagick wmctrl xvkbd
</pre></li>
</ul>

<p>
On a high level, testing consists of these steps:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Start the terminal (the unit under test) as a subprocess and note
its pid</li>
<li><p>
Obtain its X window id:
</p>
<pre class="example">
wmctrl -lp | grep &lt;pid&gt; | awk '{print $1}'
</pre></li>
<li><p>
use <code>xvkbd</code> to send events to the window:
</p>
<pre class="example">
xvkbd -window &lt;id&gt; -no-jump-pointer -text "\D3\{+1}\D3\{-1}\D3\{+Return}\D3\{-Return}\D3"
</pre>

<p>
Note the explicit keysym presses and releases, plus the interleaved delays.
For reference, see: <a href="http://t-sato.in.coocan.jp/xvkbd/">http://t-sato.in.coocan.jp/xvkbd/</a>
</p></li>
<li><p>
Make a screenshot of the window via the window id
</p>
<pre class="example">
xwd -nobdrs -id &lt;id&gt; | convert xwd:- png:- &gt; &lt;shot-name&gt;.png
</pre></li>
<li><p>
Generate a digest of the screen content, to be compared against a reference value:
</p>
<pre class="example">
identify -verbose &lt;shot-name&gt;.png | grep signature | awk '{print $2}' | cut -32
</pre>

<p>
(We cut the hash in half to make it less unwieldy.)
Having consistent hashes that depend only on the rendered pixel
image is convenient, as we do not need to store the reference images
themselves beside our test script.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The above steps are automated by some fairly straightforward bash
scripts under the <code>test/</code> subdirectory. These scripts all source the
<code>testbase.sh</code> script, which constitutes the test library.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Anatomy%20of%20a%20test%20script" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="Anatomy%20of%20a%20test%20script">Anatomy of a test script</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Anatomy%20of%20a%20test%20script">
<p>
Each executable script under <code>test/</code> is an individually runnable test
suite. It is written as a plain old bash script, sourcing the
<code>testbase.sh</code> test code library and using its facilities. For example,
<code>truecolor.sh</code> is a very simple test script to test support for setting
color attributes to truecolor (24 bit) values. The full script is
reproduced below:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">#!/bin/bash

cd $(dirname $0)
source testbase.sh

IN "source truecolor_inc.sh\r"
SNAP truecolor_01 33a31e4d3b9fbe486c27b01764dc1823
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The script starts by declaring itself as a shell script, then setting
up its working directory to be the location of the script (a
convenience to make relative file paths work in later parts of the
script, independent of the location the script was invoked from). Then
<code>testbase.sh</code> is sourced.
</p>

<p>
The actual test code is just two lines, starting with the commands
<code>IN</code> and <code>SNAP</code>. These are invocations of functions defined in
<code>testbase.sh</code> and execute in the environment set up by sourcing that
file.
</p>

<p>
<code>IN</code> will send the specified string, as keyboard input, to the
terminal under test. In our example, the shell running in the terminal
will source the file <code>truecolor_inc.sh</code> that contains some setup code
(not reproduced here) to make a certain pattern appear on the
terminal. Note the trailing <code>\r</code> that will result in a virtual <code>Enter</code>
keypress.
</p>

<p>
The subsequent <code>SNAP</code> will capture the resulting terminal window
content under the name <code>truecolor_01</code> and generate a digest (hash) of
it, comparing it with the supplied value. If the digest matches, the
output is verified to be correct; else a test failure is reported.
</p>

<p>
The snap name is used to save the captured window image under
<code>test/output/&lt;profile&gt;</code>.  This is useful for later inspection of test
results. With the default profile (see <a href="#Test%20profiles">Test profiles</a> below), the
output of this test will be saved as
<code>test/output/zutty/truecolor_01.png</code>.
</p>

<p>
There are some other useful functions exported by the test framework,
e.g.: <code>CHECK_DEPS</code>, <code>CHECK_FILES</code>, and <code>WAIT_FOR_DOT_COMPLETE</code>. If you
encounter them in test script code, it is best to look directly in
<code>testbase.sh</code> for their implementation.
</p>

<p>
Note that starting and stopping of the terminal under test is done as
part of the test framework and nothing is explicitly written in the
test script. See <a href="#Test%20profiles">Test profiles</a> below on how to control the details of
this process.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Common%20test%20script%20options">
<p>
Test scripts similar to the one shown above (building on
<code>testbase.sh</code>) all take a uniform set of command line options. All
arguments are optional, below defaults are in effect for omitted ones.
Syntax: <code>--&lt;arg-name&gt;=&lt;arg-value&gt;</code>; value defaults to "yes" if
omitted.
</p>

<pre class="example">
Option             Default
--------------------------
--ci-mode          no
--profile          zutty
--step             no
--update-sig       no

</div>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><a id="%3D--step%3D"></a><code>--step</code><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-%3D--step%3D">
<p>
The <code>--step</code> option can be given without argument, in which case it
will be equivalent to <code>--step=yes</code>, or given as <code>--step=new</code>.  The
former one will result in step mode, which will pause immediately
after each snapshot is taken (the terminal under test still displaying
this output, allowing visual inspection), and display a prompt:
</p>

<pre class="example">
[S]tep / [N]ew only / [C]ontinue / [Q]uit (s/n/c/q) ?
</pre>


<p>
This allows the user to choose how to proceed:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>S</b> - continue stepping, i.e., stop after each snapshot</li>
<li><b>N</b> - continue without stopping, except on new snapshots</li>
<li><b>C</b> - continue without ever stopping again</li>
<li><b>Q</b> - quit the test</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <code>new</code> option is useful when developing a test suite. It will run
the test script forward until a <code>SNAP</code> command without a verification
hash is found.
</p>
</div>
</li>

<li><a id="%3D--update-sig%3D"></a><code>--update-sig</code><br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-%3D--update-sig%3D">
<p>
Enabling <code>--update-sig</code> will result in a prompt on a verification
failure, i.e., when the <code>SNAP</code> command captures a screenshot with a
different hash than the reference stored in the script:
</p>

<pre class="example">
Update signature: [y]es / [N]o / [a]ll ?
</pre>


<p>
By answering <b>Y</b> here, the signature in the script will be updated.
By answering <b>A</b>, all future differences will also be updated without
a further prompt. This is useful in case the behaviour of Zutty is
changed in a way that alters its output; in case it is established
that the new output is "more correct" than the previous one; and we
want to adapt the tests to verify against this new output in the
future.
</p>

<p>
Use this with a great deal of caution. It is recommended to use <b>Y</b> in
favour of <b>A</b> and before answering each prompt, to do a careful visual
inspection of each screen for correctness.

The <code>--ci-mode</code> option sets up the test script to execute in an
unattended manner, suitable for automated testing. Step mode is turned
off (overriding <code>--step</code>), signature updates are turned off

exit with a nonzero code on a verification failure.

version of <code>vttest</code>, and will complain if the version found does not

</ul>

<p>
Apart from running all the tests via <a href="#The%20CI%20test%20script">The CI test script</a> (which you
should routinely run during development, and especially before opening
a pull request), it is also possible to run any of the above tests
manually. For example, to run the test automating a traversal of
Vttest's menu system (and in case of running against Zutty, also
verifying that results are as expected):
</p>

<pre class="example">

<p>
Do not forget about the <a href="#Common%20test%20script%20options">Common test script options</a> above; those become
useful during development (both of Zutty itself and the test suites).
For example, to run the above test step-by-step (stopping at each

<p>
The performance of Zutty can be verified with the below tests. These
are to be run manually (similar to how you run any of the
<a href="#Correctness%20tests">Correctness tests</a> on an ad-hoc basis). The goal of these tests is to
get a handle on performance under repeatable circumstances.
</p>

<p>
Since everyone's hardware and systems are different, it does not make
too much sense to compare numbers obtained by different people at
different times.  Rather, it is most useful to compare the results
obtained on the same system (running the comparison tests after one
another without any changes to the rest of the system), with the goal
of comparing a proposed set of patches to the baseline of Zutty, or to
compare Zutty with another terminal emulator.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say: when running the below scripts, your machine should
be otherwise idle.
</p>

<p>
Another consideration is that instead of the usual (debug) build used
for running tests, make sure to reconfigure and recompile Zutty to
obtain a regular (production) build to run the performance tests with,
otherwise the results will be meaningless due to excessive logging and
hitting other debug-only code paths.

per line. This test will be repeated a number of times (check
<code>TIMES</code> in the script) and the overall timing and data throughput
will be computed at the end. Since the input does not contain any
terminal controls (escape sequences), it is a measure of the raw
incoming data rate the terminal can sustain while frequently forced
to scroll/page its output. This load resembles one extreme end of
the way a terminal can be used.</li>

<li><code>cat_vtscript.sh</code>: This test generates load resembling the other
extreme end of possible terminal usage, by outputting the stream of
data written to the terminal in the course of the VTTEST cycle (see
<code>vttest.sh</code> among the <a href="#Correctness%20tests">Correctness tests</a>). However, instead of
verifying the correctness of the generated screen output, here we
are interested in the performance of processing the input stream
heavy on all kinds of escape sequences. Screen updates are dominated
by intra-screen rewrites and relatively little scrolling/paging
activity is forced.  Similar to the <code>cat_dict.sh</code> test, the input is
fed into the terminal a number of times, and overall timing and
throughput is measured and calculated.</li>

Given that our method of testing is independent of the terminal itself
(meaning that we do not rely on any hooks or test instrumentation in
the terminal itself), we can run the same tests against other
terminals, too. This is useful for comparison and research purposes.
The default profile is <code>zutty</code>, invoking the locally built Zutty
executable as the unit under test.
</p>

<p>
Profiles are defined as shell include files under <code>test/profiles</code>, and
can be invoked by passing the <code>--profile</code> option to the test
script. For example, to run the VTTEST suite against <code>xterm</code>:
</p>

<pre class="example">
./test/vttest.sh [--step] --profile=xterm
</pre>


<p>
Available profiles can be enumerated by looking in <code>test/profiles/</code>
(pass their name without the <code>.sh</code> extension to <code>--profile</code>, as
above). The list is also printed by the test script in case an invalid
profile name is given.
</p>

<p>
Each test profile contains a program invocation assigned to <code>UUT_EXE</code>,
used to launch the terminal under test with the right arguments. The
terminal must be configured so that its geometry is 80 characters wide
and 24 rows tall.
</p>

<p>
Some other variables set up in the profile encode different
capabilities to control the test scripts so that unsupported features
are skipped (and the terminal does not encounter confusing escape
sequences). Examples: <code>MISSING_ANSWERBACK</code>, <code>MISSING_DSR</code>,
<code>MISSING_SECONDARY_DA</code>, <code>SUPPORTS_VT52</code>, <code>SUPPORTS_VT220</code>. Please
check the script files for details.
</p>

<p>
Note that validation against the stored image hashes does not make too
much sense, unless preparations are made to ensure that the terminal
settings (size, font, etc.) are perfectly identical. Even then,
differences from the valid output stored for Zutty do not necessarily
constitute bugs in any other terminal, unless the rendered screen
content is visibly wrong. For this reason, auto-validation of the
saved screens runs in a relaxed mode for all profiles other than
<code>zutty</code>. This means that for terminals other than Zutty, matches are
still prominently displayed (by a line reading <code>MATCH</code> in green),
while non-matches are considered normal and indicated by <code>DONE</code>,
followed by a metric of the image difference compared to the
reference. The output image and the image generated for Zutty will be
diffed, resulting in a difference image that will highlight
differences with red.

Zutty is written in modern C++, with the customary file extensions:
<code>&lt;module&gt;.h</code> for the header, <code>&lt;module&gt;.cc</code> for the (optional)
separately compiled implementation, and <code>&lt;module&gt;.icc</code> for the (even
more optional) included implementation (inline and/or templatized
code) of a certain module. (Strictly speaking, "module" is not a thing
in C++, but I find it a useful concept, so there you go.)
</p>

<p>
A short rundown of the modules of Zutty:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>base64</code>: Base64 encoder and decoder, used by the OSC command for
clipboard interaction.</li>
<li><code>base</code>: Fundamental structures.</li>
<li><code>charvdev</code>: The virtual character device that provides the "raw
video memory" interface to the Vterm and contains/drives the OpenGL
rendering pipeline.</li>
<li><code>font</code>: FreeType-based font loader, mostly concerned with building
an atlas texture for the CharVdev to load into graphics memory.</li>
<li><code>fontpack</code>: Locates the font name's variants (regular, bold, &#x2026;)
under a search path and provides a unified point of contact to deal
with the whole bunch.</li>
<li><code>frame</code>: A Frame represents a snapshot of the content to be rendered
by the CharVdev, and is the rendering target of the Vterm. It
provides an abstraction based on character grid coordinates on top
of the raw cell storage, plus support for passing around said
storage cheaply via reference-counted pointers.</li>
<li><code>gl</code>: Low level GL utils.</li>
<li><code>log</code>: Logging facility.</li>
<li><code>main</code>: Main module for top-level tasks such as instantiating the
Fontpack, the Renderer and the Vterm; creating the X window;
selecting, parameterizing and spawning the shell; and subsequently
servicing events on the file descriptors, handling X events
(mainly around the keyboard, mouse and selection) as well as feeding
the stream of output bytes from the shell subprocess into the Vterm.</li>
<li><code>options</code>: Unified handling and support for command line switches
and X resource database entries (the former take precedence over
the latter).</li>
<li><code>pty</code>: Code for spawning a pseudo-terminal and communicating resize
events to it.</li>
<li><code>renderer</code>: The Renderer runs a separate thread to feed the CharVdev
with Frames handed off by the Vterm.</li>
<li><code>selmgr</code>: The Selection Manager contains all code that glues
together the Vterm (which is completely agnostic of any windowing
system) and the X Selection API.</li>
<li><code>utf8</code>: Support for producing and consuming UTF-encoded Unicode code
points.</li>
<li><code>vterm</code>: The Vterm implements the Virtual Terminal itself. That is,
it consumes a stream of bytes output by the shell. The Vterm
interprets the stream of text destined for the screen, interspersed
with escape sequences to control the terminal, and produces Frames
that are handed off to the Renderer.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The major modules in the architecture of Zutty are sufficiently
interesting to have their own expanded sections that follow.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-CharVdev%20%28character%20virtual%20device%29" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="CharVdev%20%28character%20virtual%20device%29">CharVdev (character virtual device)</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-CharVdev%20%28character%20virtual%20device%29">
<p>
The architectural centerpiece of Zutty is the emulation of a
character-oriented video device addressable as a plain old array of
character cells. The source module <code>charvdev</code> contains its
implementation, encompassing the GPU-hosted OpenGL ES shaders, and the
data structures to communicate with them. On the host side, the C++
code within CharVdev runs in a separate thread that does the
rendering, as driven by the Renderer.
</p>

<p>
At the interface level, the CharVdev provides access to a linear array
of CharVdev::Cell structures, each Cell having fields for the unicode
code point to be displayed, attributes (bold, italic, underline,
inverse), and color (3 bytes each for foreground and background). A
pointer to the Cells is obtained via a CharVdev::Mapping, which is a
C++ wrapper object to allow idiomatic (RAII-style) safe access to the
GL memory area backing the Cells residing on the GPU, and hides the
underlying <code>glMapBufferRange ()</code> / <code>glUnmapBuffer ()</code> calls.
</p>

<p>
Two auxiliary properties baked into the shader-based rendering, the
Cursor and the Rect defining the current selection, have setters
provided on CharVdev. These will set GL uniform variables to their
appropriate values.
</p>

<p>
The virtual video device, as driven by the array of Cells, is entirely
implemented in the OpenGL ES shaders (GLSL code embedded into
<code>charvdev.cc</code>), chiefly by the Compute Shader. The following
subsections outline the processing and the data structures backing it
at each stage.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Input%20character%20video%20memory%20area" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="Input%20character%20video%20memory%20area">Input character video memory area</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Input%20character%20video%20memory%20area">
<p>
The primary input to the OpenGL program of Zutty is a flat array of
Cell structures. It is defined as a Shader Storage Buffer Object (GL
SSBO), which means that the memory backing it is allocated by the GL
system (ultimately by the graphics driver, preferably within GPU
memory). Being an SSBO, this GL-backed object is cheap to frequently
modify (on a frame-by-frame basis), as opposed to input textures that
hold more permanent data.
</p>

<p>
The total length of the array is always equal to the terminal
size (rows x cols in characters). The cells are addressed left to
right, top to bottom. Each cell takes up 12 bytes, with 3 bytes
currently unused (available for future extensions).
</p>

<p>
By way of the CharVdev::Mapping, the application is able to obtain a
client-side mapping to this area, allowing direct manipulations of its
content.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Unicode%20to%20Atlas%20position%20mapping%20texture" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="Unicode%20to%20Atlas%20position%20mapping%20texture">Unicode to Atlas position mapping texture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Unicode%20to%20Atlas%20position%20mapping%20texture">
<p>
Font rendering is implemented by a font atlas, which is a texture
containing a bitmap of all font characters rasterized to a certain
size. The atlas is a single image held in graphics memory, divided
into character-size cells (measured by the chosen font face's pixel
dimensions) on a rectangular grid. Having all characters
pre-rasterized into a single 2D image is customary in OpenGL text
rendering, and is highly beneficial for performance and memory
reasons. Each font glyph supported by the font face has a pair of
atlas coordinates, denoting the row and column of the grid cell with
the chosen glyph.
</p>

<p>
Zutty goes a step further than most, and allows the application layer
to communicate directly by writing Unicode code points to the input
character video memory area. The translation from Unicode code point
to atlas coordinates decouples the application from having to deal
with this font-specific mapping, on a per-character basis, on the
client side.
</p>

<p>
The Unicode to atlas position mapping is created and stored on
initialization and font loading, and is read-only for the GL program.
This is a 256x256 2D texture that maps all 16-bit unicode code points
to an atlas grid position. It is initialized with the GL data type
GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA (two channels), from an array with two 8-bit
integers per texel (8 bits for either atlas grid coordinate).
</p>

<p>
This allows direct lookups for any 16 bit Unicode code point in the
shader and returns two bytes, one for the atlas row and column each.
</p>

<p>
If the value stored for atlas (row,col) is (0,0), that means there is
no glyph for that code point in the font. As a measure of convenience,
the font loader ensures that there is a blank glyph stored at that
atlas location, so no special GLSL code is needed to handle this case.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Atlas%20glyph%20texture" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="Atlas%20glyph%20texture">Atlas glyph texture</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Atlas%20glyph%20texture">
<p>
Once the atlas coordinates of the glyph to be drawn are known, the
corresponding area of the atlas glyph texture is rendered onto the
output image texture. The atlas glyph texture is a 2D image holding
all the pre-rendered glyphs supported by the loaded font. Its
dimensions are auto-computed based on the number of glyphs in the font
and the glyph dimensions, to produce a pixel size as close to square
as possible. This is necessary so the row and column coordinate will
both fit into a single byte (the maximum number of characters
rasterized from a font is 2^16 (65536), corresponding to the Unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane).
</p>

<p>
Texture encoding: 1 byte per texel, gray-scale (0 = black, 255 = white)
</p>

<p>
The atlas texture is stored as a 2D array with one layer for each font
face loaded. The mapping from unicode code point to atlas grid
location is the same across fonts, and is determined by the primary
font (loaded into texture array index 0). Each subsequent layer starts
out as a copy of the primary atlas layer, with glyphs successively
overwritten for each defined code point in the alternate font. This
means that when referencing an alternate font, the shader does not
have to care about whether the alternate font has a glyph for the
given code point &#x2013; if nothing else, the primary font's glyph will be
present.

<p>
The glyph-sized rectangle on the atlas glyph texture, as defined by
the atlas coordinates, contains a gray-scale image of the character to
be rendered. The destination of this rendering is an image,
accumulating the output from all the compute shaders running in
parallel, each rendering a single character cell in the terminal
window.
</p>

<p>
The dimensions of this image texture are set according to the terminal
window's character grid size (window size, minus split-character
border area at the bottom and right edges). The output texture is
rendered onto the viewport area using a quad in the most
straightforward way. All the work of computing the terminal window
content is done by the compute shader that sets color values of
individual pixels in the output texture.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Frame" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Frame">Frame</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Frame">
<p>
The Frame is an abstraction on top of a cell array compatible with the
one provided by the CharVdev, and provides access to cells based on
screen grid coordinates. This access layer is used by Vterm (the
virtual terminal implementation) to manipulate the cell storage that
ultimately defines the screen content.
</p>

<p>
A Frame wraps a certain cell array and abstracts away the actual
"physical" storage details of which cell (as defined by screen grid
coordinates) is stored in which array slot (as defined by array
index). The separation is necessary for efficient implementation of
scrolling. This is based on the concept of ringbuffers (circular
buffers) where upon appending to a data buffer, a write pointer is
moved around in physical storage denoting the start of a logical page,
instead of shifting all existing content (discarding the oldest bits)
to make room for incoming new data. In this scheme, data in the
buffer, once written, stays untouched until the write buffer wraps
around (by which point this data is the oldest still contained in the
buffer) and gets overwritten by the newest incoming data.
</p>

<p>
The physical storage underpinning the Frame contains an embedded
ringbuffer for the scrolling area. The virtual terminal allows a
scroll top and bottom to be set, and appending lines within these
limits will have the effect of rotating the ringbuffer without
physically moving already written data in it.  The key Frame fields
encoding the ringbuffer state are <code>marginTop</code>, <code>marginBottom</code> and
<code>scrollHead</code>. These are all row numbers, so cell offsets are obtained
by multiplying them with the number of characters in each row
(<code>nCols</code>).
</p>

<p>
To understand the memory layout of cells mapped to the screen grid,
consider the below figure:
</p>

<pre class="example">
           0 --&gt; +-----------------------+
                 |                       |
                 .          (1)          .
                 |                       |
                 +-----------------------+
   marginTop --&gt; +-----------------------+    &lt;
                 |                       |    &lt;
                 .          (3)          .    &lt;
                 |                       |    &lt;
                 +-----------------------+    &lt; scrolling
  scrollHead --&gt; +-----------------------+    &lt;   area
                 |                       |    &lt;
                 .          (2)          .    &lt;
                 |                       |    &lt;
                 +-----------------------+    &lt;
marginBottom --&gt; +-----------------------+
                 |                       |
                 .          (4)          .
                 |                       |
                 +-----------------------+
       nRows --&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The storage can be conceptually divided into four consecutive areas.
Area <code>(1)</code> between row 0 and <code>marginTop</code> (non-inclusive) is
non-scrolling (it might be empty though, if <code>marginTop</code> is zero). The
same applies to area <code>(4)</code> that begins with the row numbered
<code>marginBottom</code> and extends to the bottom of the screen (this area is
empty if <code>marginBottom</code> equals <code>nRows</code>).
</p>

<p>
The area beginning with row <code>marginTop</code> and ending just above, but not
including <code>marginBottom</code> is the scrolling area. The current logical
top of the scrolling area is marked by <code>scrollHead</code>, which is the
first row of area <code>(2)</code>. The scrolling area extends downwards to the
last row above <code>marginBottom</code>, and logically continues with area <code>(3)</code>
that starts with the row <code>marginTop</code>, ending with the last row above
<code>scrollHead</code>.
</p>

<p>
When a new row is appended to the scrolling area, <code>scrollHead</code> is
moved down, unless it would become equal to <code>marginBottom</code>, in which
case it jumps back up to <code>marginTop</code>. In any case, newly written
content will overwrite the logically-topmost scrolling row, which has
conceptually dropped off the top of the scrolling area.
</p>

<p>
The method <code>Frame::copyCells ()</code> copies all the cell content from a
frame, in logical order <code>(1)(2)(3)(4)</code>, into linear (straight) storage
elsewhere.  This is employed by <code>Frame::linearizeCellStorage ()</code>,
which in turn is used to reset the logical-to-physical mapping, e.g.,
when the scrolling limits <code>marginTop</code> or <code>marginBottom</code> are
changed. In the reset state, <code>scrollHead</code> equals <code>marginTop</code>, which
means area <code>(2)</code> fills the space between <code>(1)</code> and <code>(4)</code>, while <code>(3)</code>
is empty.

<div id="outline-container-Renderer" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="Renderer">Renderer</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Renderer">
<p>
The task of the Renderer is simple: run the rendering loop in a
separate thread. This thread executes the CharVdev code, and is
synchronized on frame updates published by the Vterm. On each update,
a reference-counted copy of the Frame (using <code>std::shared_ptr</code>) is
made. This ensures that the Frame is decoupled from the Vterm and the
render thread can keep asynchronously working with it.
</p>

<p>
The rendering loop blocks on the GL program that does the actual
drawing of the frame content (<code>CharVdev::draw ()</code>), and synchronizes
the delivery of new frames with screen refreshes (ultimately via
calling <code>eglSwapBuffers ()</code>). This mechanism ensures that there will
not be work wasted on rendering frames so frequently that they won't
be all shown on the screen. In effect, the renderer samples the "next
frame" (as updated in <code>Renderer::update ()</code>) with the screen refresh
rate and delivers it to the screen. The refresh rate is usually either
30 Hz (low-spec hardware or high resolution screens) or 60 Hz (average
laptops).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Vterm%20%28virtual%20terminal%29">
<p>
The Vterm module is the actual virtual terminal implementation. That
is, its task is to convert a stream of incoming characters containing
visual characters to display as well as control characters and escape
sequences to interpret, and alter the screen content according to the
relevant standards and specifications.
</p>

<p>
The stream of input characters are written by the pseudoterminal (pty)
slave running in a process spawned by Zutty. This is most commonly a
shell program (unless Zutty was instructed otherwise).
</p>

<p>
Parsing and interpretation of the input is fairly straightforward and
implemented (on the highest conceptual level) by a state machine that
reads input character-by-character, moves across states (Normal,
Escape, CSI, etc) and calls the registered refresh handler to deliver
an updated Frame to the renderer at appropriate moments.
</p>

<p>
An architecturally noteworthy detail is that the Vterm is completely
separated from both the rendering machinery and also from input
methods. This is intentional and lends a high degree of portability to
the Vterm implementation.
