Zutty is a terminal emulator for the X Window System, functionally
similar to several other X terminal emulators such as <code>xterm</code>, <code>rxvt</code>
and countless others. It is also similar to other, much more modern,
GPU-accelerated terminal emulators such as Alacritty and Kitty. What
really sets Zutty apart is its radically simple, yet extremely
efficient rendering implementation, enabling it to perform seamlessly
in resource-constrained environments where others struggle or fail.
At the same time, Zutty aims to implement a sufficiently complete
feature set to make it useful for a wide range of users, and strives
to conform to relevant (actual or de-facto) standards.
</p>

<p>
Zutty is written in straightforward C++ and only relies on OpenGL ES
3.1 for rendering, making it trivially portable to windowing systems
other than X and operating systems other than Linux. Zutty provides a
clean implementation written from scratch, resulting in a minimal,
maintainable, modern codebase unencumbered by historical baggage.

<p>
Zutty started out as a concept to prove the feasibility of using a
GLES Compute Shader to render a fixed-width text grid entirely in
graphics hardware. From its modest beginnings as a technological proof
of concept, Zutty has evolved considerably and is now perfectly
capable of serving as the main terminal emulator for heavy users of
the command line. In particular, this author employs Zutty to run a
workload of <code>tmux</code>, <code>emacs</code> (<code>-nw</code>), <code>tig</code>, <code>mutt</code>, <code>htop</code>, and a
bunch of other applications making extensive use of the terminal
(including its mouse support), with some Zutty instances running for
months at a time, on a very resource-constrained SBC (ab)used as a
desktop.  The correctness, performance, and stability of Zutty is
excellent, as one would rightly expect from something as fundamental
as a terminal emulator.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, a long list of ancillary features that Zutty does
not presently implement. Completing these is more or less a matter of
straightforward implementation work within the already existing
architecture of Zutty, and work will be spent on these in proportion
to popular user demand.

<p>
The main idea behind Zutty is the implementation of "raw" character
video memory via OpenGL ES 3.1. This video memory is just an array of
cells backing all character grid locations, with each cell containing
Unicode character codes plus color and other visual attributes. This
memory area, allocated on the GPU, is mapped to make it directly
writable by the application.  This results in a conceptually similar
interface as to how one could write to the screen by directly poking
at physical video memory starting at 0xB8000 on the IBM PC. Zutty
employs an OpenGL Compute Shader running on the GPU to read this video
memory and render output pixels. The full name of Zutty (dubbed the
<i>Zero-cost Unicode Teletype</i>) stands for the remarkable fact that its
image rendering is zero-cost from the host CPU perspective.
</p>

<p>
Zutty requires OpenGL ES 3.1 because this is precisely the lowest
version with support for the Compute Shader, the enabling technology
behind Zutty. We have chosen OpenGL ES over OpenGL to widen the range
of supported hardware platforms, primarily towards small, low-cost
Single Board Computers.  These boards are commonly built around an ARM
SoC with a graphics core supporting OpenGL ES, but not "desktop"
OpenGL. Zutty is the first GPU-accelerated terminal for such low-cost
platforms.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Correct%20%28and%20fairly%20complete%29%20VT%20emulation">
<p>
Zutty substantially emulates the "commonly used" subsets of the
protocols of VT52, VT100, VT102, VT220, VT320, VT420 and VT520
terminals (originally manufactured by DEC) as well as some more modern
additions defined by the de-facto standard <code>xterm</code> implementation.
</p>

<p>
We take great care to ensure that Zutty passes the subset of VTTEST
screens that we care about (this amounts to the overwhelming majority
of tests concerned with actual screen rendering, and is subject to
further extension). We have an automated regression testing setup to
run VTTEST in Zutty and verify that the output is a pixel-perfect
match of the pre-approved video output. You can thus expect the
terminal output to be <i>correct</i> &#x2013; be it driven by tmux, emacs (with
org-mode, helm, magit, etc.) or whatever else. Zutty handles several
corner cases (escape sequences) which, sadly enough, several popular
terminal emulators do not correctly support. Zutty also boasts mouse
support (substantially modeled after xterm) to make the user
experience of many terminal applications more interactive.
</p>

<p>
In a perfect world, this should not have to be listed as such a
prominent feature, but unfortunately, it is rather the exception
than the norm among widely used terminal emulators (especially the
more modern ones).

<h3 id="Font%20handling">Font handling</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Font%20handling">
<p>
Zutty supports both fixed size (bitmap) and scaled (TTF, OTF) fonts.
Up to four variants of a font are supported (Regular, Bold, Italic /
Oblique, plus BoldItalic) with automatic, sensible fallbacks in case
any of these is missing. Zutty tries to locate the font files itself
under a configured font search path, and loads them on its own
(without any support from the windowing system).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-True%20color%20support">
<p>
In each grid cell in the virtual video memory emulated via OpenGL,
three bytes are reserved for the foreground color as well as the
background color. As such, Zutty natively supports true color (24
million colors) on each cell's foreground and background, completely
independent of each other and all other cells.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Traditional%20X-clipboard%20%2F%20primary%20selection%20%2F%20copy-paste%20support">
<p>
Zutty supports the traditional method of "copy-paste" based on the X
Selection API, and is accessible via the same GUI mechanisms that
long-time <code>xterm</code> users are familiar with. Zutty can be configured to
use whichever selection target you prefer (it defaults to the PRIMARY
selection, but you might want to use CLIPBOARD instead).
</p>

<p>
Zutty faithfully replicates what <code>xterm</code> has provided for a very long
time: starting selections with the left button, adjusting them with
the right button, and cycling between snap-to-char/word/line with
double clicks. Compared with <code>xterm</code>, one notable difference is a
built-in, simpler rule for word boundaries (as opposed to
user-adjustable definitions of character classes).
</p>

<p>
Paste the selection into the terminal via middle click or
Shift-Insert, like in <code>xterm</code>.
</p>

<p>
Just as with <code>xterm</code>, terminal programs might enable one of the
supported "mouse protocols" to provide mouse interaction on their user
interfaces; in such cases, press and hold the Shift key while
performing the clicks and drags of the selection that you want to
perform (both while copying and pasting). Holding Shift will cut
through to the Zutty mouse handler instead of sending those mouse
events to the terminal program via the mouse protocol. So, regardless
of the program running in the terminal, you can always access the
built-in copy-paste support in Zutty; but you can also use whatever
mouse support your program has.
</p>

<p>
In addition, Zutty adds a unique feature for real power users of the
terminal: rectangular selection. This is extremely useful if working
with a vertically split terminal (think <code>emacs</code> or <code>tmux</code>). Simply
toggle between "regular" and "rectangular" selection mode with the
Space key while a selection adjustment is in progress (left or right
mouse button is held down). For your convenience, this setting
persists over individual selections made, throughout the lifetime of a
running Zutty terminal.

<p>
The radical simplicity of our rendering technology allows for a
straightforward virtual terminal implementation that happens to be
extremely performant despite the lack of any fancy optimizations on
the source code level.  This also allows the codebase of Zutty to be
very small (well under ten thousand lines, including comments and
empty lines) and highly readable. Therefore, Zutty lends itself
towards educational use and as a vehicle for hacking on terminals. If
you've always wanted to learn how a terminal emulator works from the
inside out, consider studying the Zutty codebase (and associated
documentation)!

<h2 id="Omissions%20and%20limitations">Omissions and limitations</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Omissions%20and%20limitations">
<p>
There are things that Zutty does not implement compared to other, more
commonly used X terminal emulators (<code>xterm</code> being the gold standard of
completeness here). The below list gives an overview of what is
missing.  Some of them are considered out of scope for Zutty, but some
are marked as possibly being implemented in the future.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Zutty currently does not support scroll-back. It is easy and
straightforward to use programs such as <code>screen</code> or <code>tmux</code> if you
want persistent tty sessions with scrollback and lots of other bells
and whistles, and Zutty supports this kind of usage very well.
Therefore, scrollback has always been low on the list of priorities.
However, we are not ideological about this and there might come a
time when scroll-back will be implemented.</li>

<li>Zutty is opinionated about the primacy of UTF-8, which means that
non-UTF-8 interaction is generally not supported, not even via
bridges such as <code>luit</code>.  DEC builtin character sets (such as the DEC
Special Graphics, DEC Technical Characters, etc.) and the escape
sequences to enable them are well implemented though, so users of
any modern Linux environment should never run into trouble.</li>

<li>Zutty is Unicode-based, but it is a terminal emulator, not an
all-purpose Unicode program. Therefore it does not aim to implement
the whole breadth and depth of glyph and language support that
Unicode defines.  Currently not supported:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Characters with a code point above 0xFFFF (that is, outside of the
Basic Multilingual Pane);</li>
<li>Bidirectional (right-to-left) text;</li>
<li>Composing characters (things that can only be represented as a
base glyph plus one or more composing glyphs superimposed, even in
Unicode NFC representation). This might possibly be implemented
later if there is sufficient interest.</li>
<li>Possibly more esoteric features.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Double-width characters (necessary for e.g., drawing CJK glyphs) are
not supported. Double-height lines are likewise not supported.</li>

<li>Rectangular area operations (introduced by the DEC VT400 series) are
not supported. However, this set of features is optional and the
terminal's self-identification message clearly states the absence of
this support, so conforming client applications should not run into
any trouble. No fundamental technical reasons here other than the
lack of pressing need.</li>

<li>The mouse protocol implementation aims to be complete with the
exception of highlight tracking mode that is not implemented. Mouse
highlight tracking is a mode that requires cooperation from the
client application; it is not clear if any software actively used in
2020 needs this feature. Also, all events for mouse buttons above
the conventional five (three buttons plus scroll wheel up/down) are
discarded.</li>

<li>Blinking in general (blinking text driven by the SGR attribute 5,
and blinking cursor mode turned on/off by VT100 "private" set/reset
mode escape sequences) are not (yet) supported. Certain more
esoteric text attributes, such as the "concealed" bit, are also not
implemented. This is purely due to lack of bandwidth, and will most
likely be added in the future.</li>
</ul>
