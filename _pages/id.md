You have reached the personal pages of Tom Szilagyi.

Along with my collection of [public repos], this is mostly a loose
collection of stuff I worked on and accumulated over the years. I also
have a handful of posts written out of personal interest.

As an industrial software engineer, most of my professional output
cannot be made available to the general public.

You can reach me by [email]. You are encouraged to make use of my [PGP
public key].
