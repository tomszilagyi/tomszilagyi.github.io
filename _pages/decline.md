[Decline] was recorded with my band *Submareen* during the better
parts of 2011-2012. This album undoubtedly contains my best electric
guitar work. I was not only guitarist, but also wrote or co-wrote most
of the material, including all the lyrics. I was also the person
engineering the album. That said, we were an amateur band and the
record was not professionally produced, nor did we have the facilities
to do so ourselves. This certainly shows in retrospect. At the same
time, the album is a testament to our determination to produce
something great amidst severe circumstances. Above all the
shortcomings and flaws, I'm still proud of the guitar work I managed
to do on this album.

You can immediately listen to [Decline] in its entirety by following
the link. You can download it in any format (including lossless) free
of charge. The lyrics are available over there, too.

Trivia: I used just one electric guitar, the [Excalibur], on the whole
album. It was recorded through a TSL-100 amplifier with dual micing
and minimal effects. Before the guitar solo recordings to finish the
last track ([Avoiding the 9-to-5 society], which turned out to be my
favourite on the album) the TSL broke down, caused by a runaway
overheating issue. I needed to service the amp and change all four
power tubes just to be able to finish recording the solos that would
complete the guitar parts of the album.
