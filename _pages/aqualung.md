[Aqualung] was the first massive piece of open source software I was
heavily involved with. I started the project in 2004 after frustration
with the lack of gapless audio players in Linux. The project was
hosted by SourceForge; we had our code in CVS (later SVN) and our
discussions on our own not-so-silent (at the time) mailing list.

The project reached its goals pretty quickly: in a few months, I was
satisfied with the abilities and the stability of the program, and
deemed it satisfactory for my own use. However, the rather dismal
state of Linux audio software back then meant that there was real
demand for this kind of program: users started to come in. And they
had a lot of feature requests. Thankfully, a few other developers also
signalled interest in joining the project, and we had a lot of fun
putting in ever more features. Eventually, the codebase was
approximately some 70,000 lines of a C-ish mess...

Aqualung found its way into most major Linux distributions (even
though we were hostile towards them by not providing regular releases
-- we were just living off our repo). One of them (Lubuntu) even made
Aqualung their default music player for a while. Others kept referring
to Aqualung as a robust, feature-rich but still lightweight music
player. We got decent coverage and a lot of translation files.

After more than 10 years (most of the later ones fairly inactive), we
released Aqualung 1.0 in August 2015. I handed over maintainership to
long-time contributor and co-developer [Jeremy Evans]. His git
repository is now the [official repo] of Aqualung. The program's
[homepage] has also been transferred to a subdomain of his site.
