It’s called *Tachyon Studio*. The glorious name refers to a rented out
small basement room used for all the rehearsals and recording work for
[Decline]. We moved in here in the spring of 2010 and dismantled the
place after the album was finished at the end of 2012.

*Welcome to Tachyon Studio*

All in one place. It’s very cozy, but a bit small. Because it is
basically a bunker (in other words, a hole in a large bulk of
concrete), treating the space acoustically has made a huge
difference. There are (if I recall correctly) 66 pieces of self-made
acoustical absorbers each 60 by 100 centimeters, 4 cm thick. Each
panel is a slice of mineral wool hot-glued into a frame of polystyrene
(or, actually, the other way around – the slices of polystyrene are
hot-glued on the edges of the mineral wool panel to provide a
frame). I used two types of mineral wool, one with a density of about
40 kg/m3 and the other with about 90 kg/m3, this heavier one is used
in the corners as much as possible. Read [this] if you are interested
in studio acoustics and what you can do to improve yours. Let me tell
you, it’s worth every minute you will spend on it. As I already
mentioned, you will find these panels everywhere in the room, in
corners, on walls and even beneath (most of) the ceiling.

Recording equipment: a self-assembled 8U rack with a PC in it (running
[Ardour] on Ubuntu Linux), featuring an LCD monitor panel built
straight into the front lid of the rack (which is fastened to the rack
on hinges to make the front lid nicely openable). On the screen, you
may notice the window of [IR.lv2], the convolution reverb I expressly
created for supporting the mixing works of Decline.

*This is portable*

With some hacking I managed to setup a Pinnacle infra remote to
control Ardour’s cue & record operations. I can start & stop playback
and even recording; stop and delete a bad take with a single button;
jump around between position markers etc. The remote enables me to
record takes of my own playing efficiently, without having to move
back and forth between my playing position and the engineering seat.

I don’t really use outboard effects, just a dual tube preamp with
optical compressors. I have a self-engineered and self-built 8-channel
microphone preamp which is very transparent and is the workhorse of
the studio along with a Delta 1010 rack-mounted audio interface. The
preamp is built using Analog Devices SSM2019 op-amps – I plan to
publish the electronic and mechanical design of this unit
sometime. There is also a TerraTec EWS88MT in the rack for additional
audio channels; the two interfaces together provide 16 simultaneous
24/96-capable channels. The two interfaces run in sample-sync via
S/PDIF and are trunked into one 16-channel logical interface within
Linux via ALSA.

Microphones: I have pieces of SM57, SM58, SM81, Beta57A, Beta58A,
Beta52A. I like to record guitar cabinets with a dual mic setup (SM57
and SM81 placed close to each other, phase aligned, about 40 cm from
the cab, pointing towards the same speaker cone). Vocals, acoustic
guitars and cymbals are recorded with SM81; drums with Beta57A (kick
drum with Beta52A). SM58 and Beta58A are only used for live vocal
reinforcement. I have a self-made popfilter for studio recording of
vocals with SM81, and it works very well.

I use a TSL100 (half-stack with a 1960A cab) for all guitar work. It
provides a vast range of tonal options together with my [Excalibur].
There is a 6+4 channel, 2 x 350W PA system useful for live playing.
With the drumkit permanently prepared for recording, and all the
amplifiers, stands and cables, it gets pretty crowded.

Studio monitors are Adam P11As. The self-made wooden stand doubled as
storage for my external backup harddisk. Check it all out:
